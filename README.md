=====================================

##### This is DeepOnion legacy source code. It is superseded by the new code based on the latest bitcoin/litecoin codebase. All DeepOnion features are ported to the new codebase. The legacy codebase will be frozen unless for the critical bug fixes. It will co-exist with the new wallet for a while, then we will stop using the legacy codebase (timeline to be determined).

#### Starting from December 10, 2019, the legacy code will no longer be supported by the DeepOnion dev team.

DeepOnion (ONION) is an anonymous and untraceable cryptocurrency. All transactions are private and sent through the TOR network.

The integration with TOR ensures that users are always on a secure environment. There is no client-side configuration needed. Our client will automatically join the TOR network and connect to available TOR nodes on the network (including our seed nodes). After a successful connection to the DeepOnion network, you may check your displayed IP using the DeepOnion client console, where you will see that your client is assigned a TOR hidden service address (.onion address).

#### Pluggable Transports

>DeepOnion has expanded and added the option for advanced users to configure PTs such as obfs4 & Meek.
